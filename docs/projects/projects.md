![Building... something](/assets/img/undraw_building_blocks_n0nc.svg)

Check out what I'm up to in my free time, in approximately reverse chronological order.

This is rough contemporaneous documentation of projects I'm working on. Its main purpose is to be reference for myself in case I find myself doing something similar in the future. It's based on the concept of documentation I learned in [How To Make (Almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/people/julia-ebert/): it should be honest about your process, your mistakes & failures, and be done *while* you work (not after), so you don't sugar coat it and leave out the interesting/important details. Also a lot of pictures.
