## About

Are you stuck self-quarantining with a basement full of 3D printers and miscellaneous electronics?

No?

Well, [Clark](https://cbteeple.github.io/) and I are. So we decided to use our free time, basement junkyard, and combined engineering powers to build a robot that could be *sort of* useful in this pandemic.

Here's what we have in mind: a small wheeled robot with an arm on top that can grab things. In theory, this could be used to grab deliveries off of your porch so you don't have to go outside. In practice, it will probably wander around and bump into walls, like a Roomba without the usefulness of being a vacuum cleaner.

As a mechanical engineer, Clark is excited about designing and building the arm and gripper. I'm excited about the possibilities of what we could program this thing to do, like using an Intel Realsense to detect and pick up particular objects. We're both excited about over-engineering and over-designing this thing, and putting LEDs in it. Plus, I'm looking forward to seeing how a real engineer goes about designing and building something like this.
