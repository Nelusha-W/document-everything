This Christmas, I got a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM. I want to see how far I can push this little computer as a useful computer. So of course, I have to deck it out with equally excessive accessories: an [Argon One case](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WP9P8VW/) and [500 GB external SSD](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GZBT36/) (which costs more than the computer itself).

But at the moment, this doesn't have a real targeted practical purpose. I want to make a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), but that doesn't require this powerful of a machine. Other ideas I'm considering:

- Home VPN (so I can watch my 3D printer from anywhere!)
- Self-hosted cloud ([perhaps nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)) or NAS (something I played around with on a Pi 2 but didn't really do anything with)
- Seeing how far I can push it, using it as a desktop computer (covered in [MagPi issue 85](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/issues/85/pdf))
- Serving a website... maybe even this one (not a useful idea, since this is currently hosted free on GitHub)
- Media center (but do I really have media to warrant this?)
