![Human-sized To Do list]({{ "/assets/img/undraw_to_do_list_a49b.svg" }})

These are things I want to learn how to do or try out. Not for work or anything. Mostly to procrastinate on work. Like everything on this website. And this website itself.

---

## To Learn

- Docker containers
- Different approaches to externally accessing and controlling my 3D printer
  - OctoPrint Anywhere
  - AstroPrint
  - Polar Cloud
  - The Spaghetti Detective
  - VPN
  - Port forwarding (seemingly the riskiest)

## To Do

- Start a blog (OK, [I've already actually created a blog](https://blog.juliaebert.com), but I need to actually start writing things on it)
- Move [Lazy Baker](http://lazybaker.juliaebert.com) to my DigitalOcean VPS
  - And make it secure (`https://`)
- Try out Powerlevel10k for ZSH
- [Try using Google Drive as remote network drive](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/08/use-google-drive-ubuntu-16-04-linux-desktops)
- Add swap back to my home desktop (and maybe try switching to Pop! OS from Ubuntu?)

## To Make

- Add lighting to 3D printer
- 8" 3D-printed moon lamp (gotta figure out how I'm lighting it up. Section of a 12 V LED strip?)
