![Human-sized To Do list]({{ "/assets/img/undraw_to_do_list_a49b.svg" }})

These are things I want to learn how to do or try out.

---

## To Learn

- Docker containers
- Different approaches to externally accessing and controlling my 3D printer
  - OctoPrint Anywhere
  - AstroPrint
  - Polar Cloud
  - The Spaghetti Detective
  - VPN
  - Port forwarding (seemingly the riskiest)

## To Do

- Start a blog (OK, [I've already actually created a blog](https://blog.juliaebert.com), but I need to actually start writing things on it)
- Move [Lazy Baker](http://lazybaker.juliaebert.com) to my DigitalOcean VPS
  - And make it secure (`https://`)
