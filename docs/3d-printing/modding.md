## Camera Setup (Logitech C270)

This camera doesn't come with a standard camera screw mount, so to fit with most of the 3D printed designs, I removed the hinge connecting it to its own mount, [following this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWz1-wV8AU4). First, you pop off the rubbery end caps (they're sticky-backed). Then you unscrew a tiny Phillips head screw on the side by the wire, then push out the hinge pin. The whole thing takes under a minute and is completely painless.

Next up: adding manual focusing to the camera. This requires opening up the front cover to add a focusing ring. I followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-gYgBeiOVI) to disassemble it. You pop off the front cover by hand, unscrew the cover underneath, unscrew the PCB, and then use something sharp to cut the little dot of glue by the lens that keeps the focus fixed. In my case, I had to actually spend a little more time with an Xacto knife and tweezers to get the blob of glue out so I could freely turn the focus ring.
