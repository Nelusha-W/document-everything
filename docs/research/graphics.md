LaTeX math in posters can be added with the [built-in LaTeX extension](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/LaTeX#How_to_embed_a_LaTeX_equation_inside_Inkscape) (the easier option to set up) but this doesn't seem to allow you to edit an equation after it is created. The [texText plugin](https://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/index.html) is a nicer interface and will let you edit equations after creating

## Fabric Posters (with Spoonflower)

- Export your poster as a PNG:
  - If necessary, rotate so the output image is landscape (instead of portrait)
  - Set as high of a DPI as you can (and remember this value) while keeping it under 40 MB (the maximum file size allowed by Spoonflower). Make sure it's *at least* 300 DPI.
- Upload to Spoonflower
  - On Spoonflower, select "Design & Sell" > "Upload your Design" and upload the image
  - Under "Repeat," select "Center" to avoid repeating
  - Use the "Change DPI" option to match what you exported
  - Choose your fabric (see below -- probably Performance Piqué) and pick the amount as 1 *yard*.
  - Be sure to check in the preview that it's what you expect!
- Choose your shipping speed
  - If you planned far enough ahead, you can get $3 shipping.
  - Otherwise, the "rush" option (3 business days for production + shipping) is $25.

The recommended fabric is [Performance Piqué](https://www.spoonflower.com/performance_pique), which is a 56"-wide, stretchy, non-creasing fabric. Since it's knit, you won't have to worry about fraying edges, but you *will* have to trim the excess white-space fabric from what you receive. It costs $18/yard (after 10% designer discount).

The non-stretchy alternative suggested is [Silky Faille](https://www.spoonflower.com/silky_faille), which (as a woven instead of knit fabric) can get fraying edges and also may need ironing. (I haven't tried this option yet.)
