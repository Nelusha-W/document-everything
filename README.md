# Julia's Documentation

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fd44e2d6-5084-4a77-a373-d9dc70d2594e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/julesdocs/deploys)

This is documentation of various useful things I've figured out and will inevitably forget if I don't write them down.

## Usage

Local setup:

```
bundle update
bundle install
```


Run locally:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Github pages is currently set up for the master branch. The trick to actually getting this to work was to disable the `url` and set the `remote_theme` in `_config.yml`.
