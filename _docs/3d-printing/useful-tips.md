## MMU2S Purge Lengths

I couldn't find a comprehensive list of suggested purge lengths for switching filaments with the Prusa MMU. So here's what I've compiled from my own experiences, what I've run across online, and the manual.

This is all done on my Prusa MK3S+MMU2S with a 0.4mm nozzle. Most of my filament is Hatchbox PLA, so it's probably that unless otherwise noted. As I try more colors, I'll add them here.

| Color         | Unloaded (mm³) | Loaded (mm³) |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| White         | 50             | 150          |
| Red           | 100            | 80           |
| Black         | 150            | 60           |
| Copper        | 70             | 80           |
| Orange (PETG) | 65             | 65           |
| Blue          | 65             | 65           |
